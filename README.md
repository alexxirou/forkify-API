## Introduction

Forkify is a web-based recipe application developed using JavaScript and the Fetch API. The application fetches recipe data from the Forkify API (https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/api/v2/) and displays it to users through an interactive user interface. Users can search for recipes, view detailed recipe information, adjust the number of servings, bookmark recipes, and even upload their own recipes to the API.

## Technologies

The Forkify recipe application is built using the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- Fetch API
- HTML
- CSS
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- regenerator-runtime

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Install any necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the project folder.
4. Build the application using Parcel by running `npm run build`.
5. Open the `dist/index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

Once the application is running, users can interact with it as follows:

- Search for Recipes: Use the search bar to enter keywords and find recipes.
- View Recipe Details: Click on a recipe to view detailed information, including ingredients and cooking instructions.
- Adjust Servings: Change the number of servings, and the ingredient quantities will be adjusted accordingly.

- Upload Recipes: Share your own recipes by clicking on "Upload Recipe" and providing the necessary details.

## API Key

The application uses the Forkify API (https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/api/v2/) to fetch recipe data. No API key is required to access the public data of the Forkify API.
